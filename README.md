# TheMagicPaycheck

This is a simple program I wrote to refresh my memory of using functions and returning values from them. This program could probably be written a lot cleaner so I'll eventually come back to it in the future once I learn more about the C++ language. If anyone has changes they would like to make to make it cleaner and more easily readable please do.
